# Camera
#
# QASSA's default camera app (Aperture) is the LineageOS 20/21 one: targetSdk 33
# with a CameraX stack that expects Android 12+ semantics. On this SDK 29
# platform the Preview use case goes ACTIVE but never attaches ("Active and
# attached use case: []"), so it shows a white screen. Opt out and ship Snap
# instead - packages/apps/Snap is the camera built for this platform.
#
# Must be set before common_full_phone.mk, which is what reads it.
